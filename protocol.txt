Class Communication:

"Used by a client to connect to a server"
connect(username):
return ok : bool

"Used by a client to get list of sessions"
get_sessions()
return sessions : [(uuid, name, cur_num_players, max_num_players), ...]

"Used by a client to join a sessions"

return ok : bool, uuid : string

OR
"Used by a client to create a sessions"

return ok : bool, uuid : string

if game is full:
    <- session_started()

Session is joined:
if game is full:
    <- session_started()
<- sudoku_state(sudoku : [i_1, i_2, ..., i_81])
<- scores_state(scores : [(player_name, points), ...])

Player suggest a number:
-> suggest_number(i, j, number)
<- suggest_number_ack(i, j, ok)
<- sudoku_state(sudoku : [i_1, i_2, ..., i_81])
<- scores_state(scores : [(player_name, points), ...])

Another player has suggested a number:
<- sudoku_state(sudoku : [i_1, i_2, ..., i_81])
<- scores_state(scores : [(player_name, points), ...])

"Used by a client to leave a session"
leave_session(uuid)

All players have left except one / sudoku is finished:
